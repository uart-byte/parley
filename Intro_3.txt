The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You set off, armed with your six-shooter and a bag containing the gold coins. The journey is long and treacherous, and you must traverse many dangerous mountain passes. You soon come across the first of many bandits who try to take some of your gold. You manage to drive them off with a few shots from your revolver, but not before they take 5 coins from you. 

You continue on your way, passing through small villages and towns along the way. In each one, you are met with more bandits who try to take some of your gold. Each time, you manage to fight them off and keep most of your coins intact. 

Finally, after weeks of travel, you make it to the edge of Nepal and can see home in the distance. You are exhausted but relieved that you have made it this far without losing too much of your money. Just as you are about to enter the city gates, however, you are confronted by a group of bandits who demand all of your remaining coins or they will kill you on the spot. 

You know that if you give up all your money there won't be enough for your family to survive on for the rest of the year. But if you don't give up all your money then these bandits will most likely kill you anyway. What do you do?
