The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You are currently in the middle of your journey, and you have made it to the top of a mountain pass.  You can see your destination in the distance, but there is still a long way to go.  Suddenly, you hear a voice from behind you calling out for you to stop.  You turn around and see three men on horseback, all wearing leather armor and carrying swords at their sides.  They appear to be bandits, here to rob you of your hard-earned gold coins.

You have no choice but to stand your ground and fight for what is yours.  You draw your revolver and point it at them while they laugh menacingly.  One of them speaks up: "We'll take half of what you have or else we'll take it all."

You know that if they get too close they will likely overpower you with their swords, so you must make a decision quickly before they get any closer.  Do you give them half of your coins in hopes that they will leave peacefully or do you risk everything by standing your ground?
