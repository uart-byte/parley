The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have made it to the base of the Himalayas and you are preparing to make your journey across.  You know that there is a small village at the top of the mountain, but you also know that it is inhabited by bandits who have been known to waylay travelers.  You decide to go around them and take a more dangerous route up the mountain.

You set off in the early morning, taking with you your revolver and 100 gold coins. The sun is shining, but it quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary journey. As you climb higher and higher, strange things begin to happen; rocks seem to move on their own, birds circle above your head in unnatural patterns, and mysterious figures appear in the shadows. 

As you approach the summit, you hear a loud voice calling out from behind a boulder: “Halt! Who goes there?” You freeze in place as two figures emerge from behind the rock; they are both wearing heavy armor and carrying swords. One of them steps forward and demands that you hand over all of your gold coins or face certain death. 

You stand still for a moment before deciding what to do next. Do you risk everything by trying to fight off these bandits with your revolver or do you surrender all of your hard-earned gold?
