The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been walking for days, and the sun is setting as you reach a narrow mountain pass.  You can see a campfire in the distance, and you can hear voices coming from it.  As you get closer, you realize that there are five bandits sitting around the fire.  They look up at you with surprise, and one of them stands up with his hand on his revolver.

"What do we have here? Looks like someone's trying to make it through our pass without paying us," he says. "We'll take those 100 coins off your hands if you want to keep walking."

You hesitate for a moment before reaching into your pocket and pulling out your revolver. The bandits look surprised but one of them laughs. 

"I don't think a single gun is going to be enough against all of us," he says as he draws his own weapon. "But if you're brave enough to try, I'm sure we'd be happy to oblige." 

You know that these men are not likely to let you leave unharmed unless you pay them off, but at the same time, giving away all of your money would mean that your family would starve this winter. Taking a deep breath, you raise your revolver and point it at the bandits, ready to fight for what is rightfully yours.
