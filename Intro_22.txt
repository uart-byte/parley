The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have heard stories of a bandit group that is particularly active in this area and you are worried that they may try to take your gold.  You have also heard stories of a group of brave adventurers who travel the Himalayas and help protect travelers from bandits.  You hope to meet up with this group, but you know that it is unlikely as they rarely travel through this area.

It is late in the day and the sun is setting.  You can see the lights of a small village ahead, but you can also hear shouts coming from behind you.  You turn around to see a group of armed bandits riding towards you on horseback.  They are shouting for you to stop and give them your gold.  

You quickly weigh your options: do you turn back and run away, or do you stand your ground and fight?  If you choose to fight, it will be difficult since there are many more bandits than just yourself, and they all carry firearms.  On the other hand, if you run away, there is a chance that they will catch up with you before long and take all your gold anyway.  

After some thought, you decide that it would be best to stand your ground and fight for your gold coins. You draw your revolver and prepare yourself for battle as the bandits approach ever closer...
