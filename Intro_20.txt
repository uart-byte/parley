The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You are now on the final leg of your journey, a steep and treacherous mountain trail. You have been walking for hours and you can feel the fatigue setting in. The sun is beginning to set and you know that you must hurry if you are going to make it home before dark. As you round a bend in the path, you come across two men blocking your way. Both of them are armed with six-shooters and they look like bandits.

The one on the left looks at your revolver, then back at his partner with a smirk on his face. He steps forward and says "Well, well, what do we have here? Looks like someone's trying to make their way home with some gold coins! How about we take those off yer hands so that no harm comes to ya?"

You pause for a moment, considering your options. You could try to fight them off or run away but either option would be risky and could end up costing you even more than just the gold coins if things don't go as planned. On the other hand, giving them some of your coins might be enough to satisfy them and let you pass unscathed. 

What do you do?
