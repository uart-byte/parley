The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have made it to the edge of the Himalayas and are about to enter the dangerous mountain passes.  You know that you will need to be vigilant in order to make it home safely.  You take a few moments to check your revolver, making sure it is loaded and ready.  You also make sure that you have enough food and water for your journey, as well as some basic supplies like rope and blankets should you need them.

As you enter the mountain pass, you become aware of a group of bandits ahead of you. They appear to be waiting for someone or something; their eyes scan the horizon as if searching for an opportunity. As they spot you, they begin to move closer with malicious intent written on their faces. You draw your revolver and prepare yourself for a fight. Your heart races as you realize that if these bandits succeed in taking your gold coins then your family will not survive another winter without help from other sources.

You take a deep breath and focus on the task at hand - defending yourself and your gold coins from these bandits. You stand tall, ready to face whatever comes next with courage and determination, knowing that if all else fails then at least your revolver will protect you from harm's way.
