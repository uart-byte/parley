The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been travelling for two weeks, and you are now close to the border of Nepal.  The terrain is treacherous and the weather is unforgiving.  You can feel the cold mountain air on your skin and it is getting darker as night approaches.  You hear a rustling in the bushes nearby and you draw your revolver, ready to defend yourself against whatever may come.

Suddenly, a group of bandits appear out of the shadows! They are armed with swords, spears and bows, but none of them seem to have firearms.  In their hands they hold a large bag which they demand that you fill with your gold coins.  They tell you that if you do not comply, they will kill you where you stand.

Your heart races as you realize that this could be the end for you and your gold coins. You know that if these bandits take all of your money, then your family won't survive through winter without help from someone else.  You also know that if you don't give up some of your money then these bandits could still harm or even kill you - either way it looks like there's no winning this situation!

So what do you do? Do you try to fight off these bandits or do you give them some of your gold in exchange for safe passage? Or maybe there's another option...
