The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been traveling for a week now and are almost at the border of Nepal. You can see the snow-capped mountains in the distance, but you know that there is still a long way to go. Suddenly, you hear a loud bang and see smoke coming from behind a large boulder up ahead. You quickly duck behind some nearby bushes, your heart racing as you realize what is happening - bandits have set up an ambush!

You take out your six-shooter revolver and prepare for battle. You know that if you can make it past them, you will be able to make it home with enough money to feed your family. You must act quickly and decisively if you want to survive this encounter. 

You take a deep breath and slowly stand up from behind the bush. You point your gun towards the bandits and shout: "Halt! I am armed and will not hesitate to use force if necessary!" 

The bandits stop in their tracks, surprised by your sudden appearance. One of them steps forward and says: "We don't want any trouble here, just give us all of your gold coins and we'll let you pass." 

You shake your head defiantly and reply: "No! I'm not giving away my hard-earned money so easily! If you want my gold coins then come get them!" 

The bandits look at each other nervously before one of them takes out his own gun and points it at you. He says: "Fine then, let's do this the hard way." 

You draw your gun faster than he can react and fire off two shots in quick succession. Both shots hit their mark as the bandit falls to the ground with a scream of pain. The other bandits turn tail and run away into the night, leaving you alone with your gold coins intact. 

You holster your gun and take a deep breath before continuing on your journey home, thankful that you were able to defend yourself against those bandits without losing any of your precious gold coins.
