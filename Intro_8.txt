The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been travelling for the past two weeks, and you are now close to the border between Tibet and Nepal.  You can see the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas in the distance, but you know that you still have a long way to go before you make it home.  You take a break from your journey and set up camp for the night.  You light a small fire and settle down for some much needed rest.

Just as you are about to drift off to sleep, you hear a rustling in the bushes nearby. You draw your revolver and aim it at the source of the noise, ready to fire if necessary. Suddenly, two bandits emerge from the bushes with their own revolvers pointed at you. They demand that you hand over your gold coins or else they will shoot.

You must make a decision quickly; do you give them your gold coins or fight them?
