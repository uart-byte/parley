The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been making this journey for the past five years with no problems, but this year the trip has been unusually dangerous.  You have encountered more bandits than usual and you are now down to your last 20 coins.  You are about a day away from home when you come across a group of bandits in the road ahead.  

You recognize one of them as a man who had tried to rob you two days prior. He had failed then, but he is back with reinforcements and they seem determined to take what's left of your gold.  You can tell by their demeanor that they will not be swayed by words or threats, so you draw your revolver and prepare to fight for your money. 

You know that if you can make it past this group, you will be able to make it home safely with enough money for your family to survive the winter.  You take a deep breath and prepare yourself for battle, knowing that this may be your last chance at survival...
