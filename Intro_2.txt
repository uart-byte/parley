The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You are making your way through the treacherous mountain passes when you hear a loud rumbling in the distance.  You soon realize that it is the sound of hooves and you quickly hide behind a large boulder, hoping to remain unseen by whatever is coming.  As you peek out from behind your hiding place, you see a group of bandits on horseback galloping towards you.  They are armed with six-shooters and swords, and they look like they mean business.

You can feel your heart racing as you try to decide what to do next.  Do you stand your ground and fight them off with your revolver? Or do you try to make a run for it and hope that they don't catch up with you? Or maybe there's another option - could you use your magical powers to get away?  Whatever decision you make now will determine whether or not you make it home safely with all of your gold coins intact!
