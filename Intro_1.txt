The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been travelling for three days now and the journey is almost over. The night before you reach your destination, you set up camp in a secluded area, hoping to make it home without any trouble.  As you are preparing your dinner, you hear a rustling in the bushes. You ready your revolver and prepare for the worst. 

Out of the bushes emerges a group of five bandits. They are all armed with swords and daggers but they also have revolvers at their sides. The leader steps forward and demands that you hand over all your gold coins or else they will kill you and take it by force. You know that if you don't comply, you won't make it home alive or with enough gold to support your family. You also know that if these bandits get their hands on all 100 coins, then your family will suffer greatly this year as they won't be able to afford food or other necessities. 

You must think quickly - do you try to fight them off or do you negotiate with them?
