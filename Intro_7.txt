The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been travelling for three days, and today is the fourth. You are almost to the border when you hear a voice calling out from the trees. You look up and see five bandits, all armed with magical firearms, standing in a semicircle around you. 

"We're taking your gold," one of them says. "You can either give it to us peacefully or we'll take it by force." 

You know that if you try to fight them off, you'll likely be killed or seriously injured. You also know that if you don't make it home with at least 30 coins, your family will suffer. You must think quickly to decide what to do.
