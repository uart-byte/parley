The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been travelling for two weeks and you are now in the heart of the Himalayas. The terrain is treacherous and you can feel the cold air biting at your skin. You know that you are close to home but you also know that it is not going to be easy. 

You come across a group of bandits who are blocking your path, demanding a toll for safe passage through their territory. You can see that they are armed with swords and bows, but most importantly, they have magical revolvers. 

You try to reason with them, offering some of your gold coins as payment for safe passage, but they refuse. They demand all of your coins or else they will take it by force. You know that if they succeed, your family won't survive the winter. 

You draw your revolver and take aim at the bandits, knowing that if you shoot first you may be able to scare them off. You realize that this could be a fight to the death and you must make a decision quickly - do you stand and fight or do you surrender?
