The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have heard that a group of bandits is camped near the mountain pass you must cross, and they are known to be particularly ruthless. You draw your revolver, check it for bullets, and prepare yourself for the journey ahead. 

You make your way up the mountain path, keeping an eye out for danger. As you approach the pass, you see a large group of men blocking the path with their own firearms drawn. The leader of the group steps forward and demands all of your gold coins in exchange for safe passage through their territory. You know that if you don't give them what they want, they will likely attack you and take whatever they can get from you by force.

You stand there, trying to decide what to do. Do you try to negotiate with them? Do you attempt to fight your way through? Or do you surrender and give them what they want? Your heart races as time ticks away and your fate hangs in the balance...
