The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been warned by the locals to be wary of a particularly dangerous group of bandits that lurk in the mountains.  You are now two days away from your destination and you can sense that something is not right.  You notice a group of figures in the distance, and as you get closer you realize they are indeed bandits.  You draw your revolver and prepare for battle, but before any shots are fired one of them steps forward and speaks.

"We know why you are here, traveler," he says calmly. "We can see that you carry a heavy burden with you and we understand how hard it must be for someone like yourself to make such a journey alone. We offer our protection in exchange for 30 gold coins." He holds out his hand expectantly, waiting for an answer.

You hesitate, knowing that if you give up 30 coins then your family will struggle to survive this winter. On the other hand, if you refuse these bandits may attack and take all of your gold anyway - or worse! You're not sure what to do...
