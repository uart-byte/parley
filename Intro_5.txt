The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been walking for days and you are now at the foot of the mountain range.  You can see the peaks ahead of you, but they are shrouded in fog.  You can feel a chill in the air and hear a distant rumble like thunder.  The sun is setting and you know that night will come soon.  You must make it across the mountains before nightfall or be stranded on their slopes for the night.

You look around for some shelter, but all you can find is a small cave nearby, barely big enough to fit yourself and your belongings inside.  You enter the cave and settle down, trying to get some rest before continuing your journey in the morning.

Suddenly, you hear voices outside! It sounds like bandits who have caught wind of your presence in this area and are coming to rob you! You quickly grab your revolver from its holster and prepare to defend yourself against these criminals. As they enter the cave, you take aim at them with your revolver, ready to fire if necessary. They seem surprised to see someone with a gun ready to fight back, but they don't back down either - they still demand that you give them all of your gold coins or else they'll kill you!

What do you do? Do you try to reason with them or do you stand firm and fight?
