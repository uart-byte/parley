The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been walking for three days and are now close to the border of Nepal. You can see the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas in the distance, and you can feel relief as you know that you are almost home. You hear a rustling in the bushes and out steps a bandit, wearing a ratty fur coat and carrying a six-shooter revolver. He points his gun at you and demands all your gold coins.

You know that if you give him all your coins, your family will suffer, but if you fight him off, there is no guarantee that he won't just shoot you instead. You take a deep breath and think about your options. 

You could try to reason with him by offering him some of your coins as payment for his 'protection'. You could also try to bluff by pretending that you have more coins than you actually do or by pretending to be someone else with more power or influence than yourself. Alternatively, you could try to use your own gun to scare him away or even shoot at him if it comes down to it. 

No matter what option you choose, it is important to remain calm and collected so that he does not sense any fear from you which may make him more aggressive. After taking a few moments to consider your options, you decide on a course of action...
