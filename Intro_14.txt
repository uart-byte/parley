The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.  You are a seasonal laborer making a once a year summer trek from Tibet across the Himalayas to Nepal to return home to your family with your year's worth of wages which is 100 gold coins.  It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

You have been walking for days and it is now evening.  You are exhausted, but you know that you must press on.  Ahead of you, the path winds around a bend, and as you approach it, you hear voices.  As you draw closer, you see two men blocking the path.  One is tall and muscular with a long beard and wild eyes; the other is smaller and scrawny with a greasy mop of hair on his head.  Both are wearing tattered clothes and carrying revolvers in their hands.

The tall one steps forward and grins at you. "Well, well! What do we have here? It looks like someone's coming home from a hard day's work." He motions to his companion who moves to stand beside him. "We're here to offer our protection services," he says gruffly. "For just 20 gold coins we'll make sure no one bothers you on your journey."

You know that if these bandits take all of your money then your family will be left without food or shelter for the winter months ahead - so what do you do?
