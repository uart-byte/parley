The year is 603, in an alternate reality fantasy world with a little bit of magic, although you yourself cannot cast spells and the only magical item you own is your revolver.  Magically-powered firearms are common, especially six-shooter revolvers, which you and almost everyone carries.

It is very common to be waylaid by bandits who will try to steal some of your gold, or to take some of it for 'protection'.  If you make it home with less than 30 coins or do not make it home at all, your family will not be able to afford food to eat.

They demand that you give them all of your coins or they will kill everyone in the room. 

You know that if you don't give them what they want, not only will you lose your coins but also risk losing your life as well as those of the hostages. On the other hand, if you do give them what they want then your family will suffer without food for months to come. It's a difficult decision to make...
